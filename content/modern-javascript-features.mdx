JavaScript is constantly evolving, with new features making code more expressive and efficient. Here are some highlights:

- **Optional Chaining (`?.`)**: Safely access deeply nested properties.
- **Nullish Coalescing (`??`)**: Provide default values only when something is null or undefined.
- **Async/Await:** Write asynchronous code that looks synchronous.
- **Template Literals:** Embed variables and expressions in strings easily.

Staying up-to-date with modern JavaScript features will help you write cleaner and more maintainable code.
