# Markdown

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It's simple to learn and helps you write documents that can be easily converted to HTML for websites, or just look great on places like GitHub, Reddit, or note-taking apps.

---

## 1. Headings

Headings are created with `#` symbols:

```
# This is a Heading 1
## This is a Heading 2
### This is a Heading 3
#### This is a Heading 4
```

The more `#`, the smaller the heading.

---

## 2. Paragraphs

Just write text normally. To start a new paragraph, leave an empty line between blocks of text.

```
This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
```

---

## 3. Emphasis (Bold and Italics)

- *Italic* — Wrap the text in one asterisk `*` or underscore `_`.
- **Bold** — Wrap the text in two asterisks `**` or underscores `__`.
- ***Bold and Italic*** — Three asterisks `***`.

```
*italic* or _italic_

**bold** or __bold__

***bold and italic***
```

---

## 4. Lists

**Unordered list** (bullet points):

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
* Item 3
```

**Ordered list** (numbered):

```
1. First item
2. Second item
   3. Subitem 2.1
   4. Subitem 2.2
5. Third item
```

---

## 5. Links

To create a hyperlink:

```
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

Example:  
[OpenAI](https://openai.com)

---

## 6. Images

Images are similar to links but start with an exclamation mark `!`:

```
![Alt text](https://example.com/image.png)
```

Example:  
![Example Image](/images/project-thumbnail.png)

---

## 7. Code

**Inline code** (inside a sentence):

```
Use the `code` keyword.
```

Result:  
Use the `code` keyword.

**Code blocks** (for multiple lines of code):

    ```
    def hello():
        print("Hello, World!")
    ```

You can also specify the language for syntax highlighting:

    ```python
    def hello():
        print("Hello, World!")
    ```

---

## 8. Blockquotes

To create a blockquote:

```
> This is a blockquote.
> 
> It can span multiple lines.
```

---

## 9. Horizontal Line

To create a horizontal divider:

```
---
```
or
```
***
```

---

## 10. Tables

Simple tables look like this:

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | More Data|
```

# Tips for Writing Markdown
- **Preview as you go** if your editor supports it.
- **Keep it readable**: Markdown is meant to be human-readable even without formatting.
- **Use lightweight editors**: Apps like Typora, Obsidian, Visual Studio Code, or web-based tools like Dillinger.io are great for writing Markdown.
